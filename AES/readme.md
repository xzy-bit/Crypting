### Introduction
This directory contains the codes related with **AES Algorithm**.\
aes128.java / aes.java is the immplment of the AES-128/AES-192/AES-256 algorithm.\
### Details
### aes128.c
The input contains four lines.\
The first line contains a positive integer $T$ , which represents the number of encryption/decryption times. The same key is used.\
The second line is a hexadecimal string $s$ , starting with `0x`and representing the text, guaranteed $|s|=34$;\
The third line is a hexadecimal string $k$ , starting with `0x`, which is the key, guaranteed $|k|=34$;\
The fourth line is a non-negative integer $op$ , representing the encryption/decryption mode, 1 for encryption, and 0 for decryption.\
The Output is a string beginning with `0x` , representing the result of crypting/decrypting.
